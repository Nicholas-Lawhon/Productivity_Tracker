Productivity Tracker
===================

This application helps you track your productivity by timing your tasks.

Setup:
1. The app will create necessary folders in your home directory automatically.
2. If you want to use Google Sheets sync, place your API credentials in:
   ~/ProductivityTracker/credentials/sheets-credentials.json

Troubleshooting:
- If the main application has issues, try the debug version which shows detailed logs.
- Check logs in ~/ProductivityTracker/logs/ for more information.
